This, however, is very costly and not desired because the school does not need more traffic lights most of the time. Second, we can have police officers or contruction workers physically monitor the traffic. This is currently the most frequently used solution because workers can directky see and make decisions that can aid the traffic flow real-time. However, the percentage for error will drastically increase as humans try to cover more area to control the traffic with more people. They are prone to mistakes and cannot work long hours. Finally, there are many companies offering "portable" traffic lights. These are expensive, often just for rental, and highly complicated to set-up/configure/monitor. They are also not very portable since the products are big, bulky, and require a lot of work for installation.</div>

        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>Traffic has always been a prevalent problem at Georgia Tech. Local commuters would tell you that the time to leave campus ALONE would take about 15 minutes. This is specifically due to a combination of classes all ending at the same time, the myriad of professors and students leaving the campus, and most importantly, pedestrians.
